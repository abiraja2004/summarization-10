# summarization
Text Summarization of news articles in Neural Networks using Keras

This project was undertaken to perform abstractive summarization on a news corpus by making use of deep learning models like encoder-decoder networks.

Tasks performed:
1. Developing a unidirectional LSTM based encoder-decoder network for title generation corresponding to each lede.
2. Improvement of the model using attention.
3. The scores were evaluated using ROUGE scores.
